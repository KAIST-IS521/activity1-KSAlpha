# IS521-2019S Activity 1

The goal of this activity is to create a program which is available to validate a CSV file and to read fields of the specific column of the well-formed (valid) CSV file.

So, the problem is consisted of three parts:

1. Validating a CSV file
2. Extracting fields of the specific column from records
3. Printing extracted fields



## Algorithm

### Validating a CSV file

This project suggests Finite State Machine (FSM) with three extra rules to solve this problem.

Based on a [RFC4180][RFC4180] given in the activity readme file of this course, I created a simple FSM to validate the syntax of a CSV file.

Note: `LF` without preceding `CR` in state `U` will be rejected in the algorithm even it is not drawn in this figure.

(SVG created using [Finite State Machine Designer][FSMD])

Unfortunately, this model is not able to express rule 2, 3 and 4 of [RFC4180][RFC4180]. Three extra rules are added to address this:

1. Even if `EOF` is reached without preceding `CRLF`, the algorithm assumes that `CRLF` exists at the end of the file.

   This handles rule 2 (i.e., optional `CRLF` ending of the last record).

2. Optional header record is ignored as it doesn't affect the output of the program (Also, there is no deterministic way to recover an intended MIME type using only a file).

   This resolves rule 3 (i.e., optional header record recognized by MIME type definition in the beginning of the file).

3. Fields in each record are counted and compared after the FSM algorithm terminates with `Ok` state.

   This addresses rule 4 (i.e., one or more fields in each record and equal number of fields in each record).

`Ok` state continues the algorithm and `Err` state terminates the program with status code 1.



### Extracting fields of the specific column from records

Fields and records are parsed using the output of the FSM of the previous step (i.e., CSV validation). Parse result is expected to have a type of `string[] list`, which inner arrays are arrays of fields and outer list is a list of records. This process is expected to be merged into the algorithm of the previous step.

Wanted fields are extracted by mapping inner lists into fields, which is achieved by selecting the entry using the specific index of the list. In this process, `IndexOutOfRange` exception may occur due to bad user inputs.

Any exceptions result in exiting with status code 1. Otherwise, the algorithm continues.



### Printing extracted fields

The program creates a string by joining extracted fields with a desired line break (i.e., `LF` in Unix, `CRLF` in Windows), writes out the string to `stdout` and exits with status code 0. Unexpected low-level I/O exceptions during write is not handled in the algorithm.



## Possible improvements

- Better memory management

  The na√Øve approach in memory management of this algorithm may cause an out-of-memory (OOM) exception when handling extremely large files.

- Relax line break condition

  The algorithm rejects `LF`, which is a default line break in Unix systems, as a record delimiter. This design was chosen to strictly follow [RFC4180][RFC4180]. However, this can result in unnecessarily strict behavior to users.

- Better error handling

  Some violations are squashed into an indistinguishable `Invalid` state. This can be improved by handling each violations respectively.



## Running the program

This program is written in F# and is targeted to be run on [.NET][dotnet] Core 2.2 runtime.

You can run this program with the following commands:

```bash
$ cd Activity1
$ dotnet run your_file.csv 1
# or
$ mkdir build
$ dotnet build -o ../build
$ dotnet build/Activity1.dll your_file.csv 1
```
